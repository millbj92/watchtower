# 🏠 Watchtower Investor Deck

## 🚫 The Problem
- Voter suppression, equipment failures, long wait times, and disinformation occur regularly during elections—often with little to no verifiable public record.
- Existing systems for incident reporting are fragmented, inaccessible, or controlled by private institutions.
- There's no trusted, public, tamper-proof system to track real-time election integrity issues.

---

## 🔀 The Solution
**Watchtower** is an open-source, Ethereum-powered platform that enables voters, poll workers, campaigns, and civic orgs to:
- Submit election-day incident reports in real time
- View incidents on a live dashboard
- Log cryptographic proofs on-chain (via Base testnet)
- Ensure transparency, traceability, and tamper-resistance
